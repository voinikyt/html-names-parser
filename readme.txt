There are example scripts for Windows shell in \shell\src\main\scripts.

The shell module generates a zip file containing the stand-alone distribution of the application.

The entrance point in the application is com.ontottext.interview.cltool.Main class.

New scripts may be written invoking the genetated jar file of the shell module.
